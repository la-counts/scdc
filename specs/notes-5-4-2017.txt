Notes from client meeting.

* How to select stories for the front page? (assuming it should be curated)
* Each panel in user overview gets its own page (ie save searches)
* Dataset gets a subhead or does it just use curated_collection?
* Apply hard limit for displaying "linked" items and
** link to search for more items (search stories by dataset id, search datasets by story id)
** Order by Most recent?

* Linked -> curated
* Related -> broad search over meta fields (tags & concepts)

drop linked stories from story, related stories only

add comments to stories

search for signed in users only? seems mobile has a different workflow...

tags => user_tags (auto complete from concepts though)
